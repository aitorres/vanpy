## Other blurb

## Standard info
* Everyone who comes should follow the [code of conduct](https://github.com/vancouver/vanpy/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md), which we will enforce. Be nice to each other and make a space we can all visit.
* We'll try to make every meeting a hybrid one, so people can can join remotely. We do understand that not everyone is comfortable turning up to a room full of people.
* If there is a room limit, we'll come up with a system to figure that out.
* Recording the meeting isn't something we plan on doing just yet.
* We encourage speakers to share their slides and demos later on if possible, but its up to the speakers.

That's it, we hope you can join us and come hang out with fellow Python people.
