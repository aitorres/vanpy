# Code of Conduct

The VanPy meetup and its organizers are dedicated to providing a safe, respectful, harassment-free community for everyone. 

We expect you as an attendee and a online or offline participant to

* be friendly and patient,
* be welcoming,
* be considerate and respectful,
* be careful in the words that you use.

If you are being made to feel unsafe, uncomfortable, you feel the code of conduct has been violated, or you notice this happening to someone else, please contact an organizer directly or email conduct@pyvr.org.

## Definition of Harassment

Harassment and exclusionary behaviour is not acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion
* Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
* Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour
* Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like “*hug*” or “*backrub*”) without consent or after a request to stop.
* Stalking or following
* Harassing photography or recording
* Violent threats or language

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, representatives of the community may take reasonable action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender, expulsion from any VanPy event, or expulsion from mailing lists, IRC chats, discussion boards and other electronic communications channels to resolve the issue. This may include expulsion from the VanPy meetup group.
